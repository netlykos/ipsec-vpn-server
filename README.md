# IPSec VPN Server on Raspberry PI as Docker instance

This project contains the code and build files required to run a IPSec VPN Server as a docker instance on a Raspberry PI. It's inspired by similar projects (see [Links](#Links)) and was used by myself to learn more about:
- Docker: Build process, management and other items
- IPSec: Configuration and management of a IPSec service
- Raspberry PI: What it can and cannot do

## Docker
This section covers items related to docker

### Build Docker image
To build the docker image and associate it the container, run the below command in the same directory as the ``docker-compose.yaml`` and ``Dockerfile``.

```
docker-compose build
```

### Docker image management
To see if the docker image from the above step - shows details like repository, tag, creation date and size (reason I switched to alpine).
```
docker images
```

To remove images (either because they have been updated or for another reason)
```
docker rmi <hash> | <repository>
```

### Commands related to docker container management
To see if the docker image from the above step - shows details like, repository, tag, creation date and size.
```
docker container ls -a
```

Spin up a container and interact with it
```
docker -it netlykos/ipsec-vpn-server
```

Like previous, but reclaim/prune it upon exit
```
docker run --rm -it netlykos/ipsec-vpn-server
```
